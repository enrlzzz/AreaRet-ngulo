# Trapezoid Area Calculator

This repository contains a simple Java program that calculates the area of a **trapezoid**. Although the class name is `AreaRetangulo`, the formula used, $A = \frac{(b + B) \cdot h}{2}$, is for a trapezoid. This is a great example of how to implement a basic geometric formula in code.

The program uses hard-coded values for the first base (`b = 6.0`), the second base (`B = 8.0`), and the height (`h = 5.0`) to perform the calculation and print the final area to the console.
